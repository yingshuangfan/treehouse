    "**One-class Classification(OCC):** Identify objects of **a specific class amongst all objects**, by primarily learning from a training set containing **only the objects of that class**(not necessarily). It is more difficult than the traditional classification problem, which tries to distinguish between two or more classes with the training set containing objects from all the classes.

    "**Support Vector Data Description(SVDD):** SVM based one-class classification, which relies on identifying the smallest hypersphere (with radius $r$, and center $c$) consisting of all the data points $x = (x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$. The problem can be defined as:\n",
